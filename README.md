_Second Foundation
==================

A responsive starter theme with Foundation. Works as is but has very few options.

Version 1.x followed the "All the options! All the things!" design philosophy. Version 2.X is about "Decisions, not options" and therefore has almost no options.

In the future I will create filters to change options, so I can set them via a plugin. I may even create a plugin to set the options via the customizer.
