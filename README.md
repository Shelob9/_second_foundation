_Second Foundation
==================

A responsive starter theme with for the Foundation Framework.

Version 2.0.2 is almost done, has a few bugs left.

Version 1.x followed the "All the options! All the things!" design philosophy. Version 2.X is about "Decisions, not options" and therefore has almost no options.

In the future I will create filters to change options, so I can set them via a plugin. I may even create a plugin to set the options via the customizer.
