_second_foundation
==================
Second Foundation is a starter theme for WordPress by Josh Pollock. The current Master branch is a fully functional WordPress theme with minimal style. All Foundation JS is included but is lacking settings files and functions to make it work.

Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. You can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Foundation, which includes layout constructs (like a fully responsive grid), elements and best practices.

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Foundation wouldn't be possible without the support of the entire ZURB team, our friends and colleagues who gave feedback, and some luminaries who did some heavy lifting that we took advantage of (thanks guys).
