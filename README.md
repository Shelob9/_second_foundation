_second_foundation
==================
Second Foundation is a starter theme for WordPress by Josh Pollock. The current Master branch is a fully functional WordPress theme with minimal style. All Foundation JS is included but is lacking settings files and functions to make it work.

ABOUT THIS BRANCH:
=================
Most recently I made infinte scroll work in this branch.
My next projects are AJAX page loads and creating page templates and settings for Foundation JS.
This is the branch I am messing with the most, be careful about using it in production.

Foundation

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Foundation wouldn't be possible without the support of the entire ZURB team, our friends and colleagues who gave feedback, and some luminaries who did some heavy lifting that we took advantage of (thanks guys).
