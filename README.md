==================
An advanced starter theme with a mobile-first, responsive design. It features AJAX page loads, Infinite Scroll, Masonry blog page, an optional front page slider, full screen backgrounds and user-configurable color options. Can be used as theme as is, but makes a great starter theme for custom designs, as it already has all of the cool features you need built-in.

Key Features:
============
* Responsive Layout.

* Adaptive image sizing.

* AJAX Menu.

* Masonry Page Layouts.

* Full-Screen Backgrounds,

* Home Page Slider.

* All options implemented via WordPress customizer.

Child Theme
===========
A starter child theme is available [here](https://github.com/Shelob9/second_speaker). It is designed to make it easy to override and if necessary replace scripts, styles and even whole parts of the parent theme's functions library.
